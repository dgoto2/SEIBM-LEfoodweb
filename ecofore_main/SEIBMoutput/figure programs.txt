1D_recruit
Makes recruitment (age-o survival) plots for each species.  Change value of "ff" to do a subset of species.

1D_temp_DO_bigger
Contour plots of DO and temperature inputs for June 1 - December 1.
Must compile 'colorbar.pro' before this runs.

1D_zoop_light
Contour plots of light and zooplankton abundance.  It collects data for all time periods, but only plots one at a time.
Just change the data to be plotted and figure title, highlight the plot, press shift+F8.
Must compile 'colorbar.pro' before this runs.

1Ddepth_heatmap
Depth heatmaps for all species.
Uses data from 1Dplot or 1dplot_longer and 'colorbar.pro' must be compiled before this runs.

1Dplot
Makes summary plots of population, average length, average weight, average biomass, and average depth for all species.
Not modified to use with longer output.

1Dplot_age class
Makes age-class specific plot of average depth for one species.

1Dplot_age_time
Makes age-class and timing specific plots of depth for all species.
Contains instructions for plotting the vertical movements of single superindividuals.

1Dplot_diel_depth
Average depth for one species at a given time of day.
Not modified to use with longer output, REDUNDANT.

1Dplot_limited
Specific version of 1Dplot, can save time if just one specific graph is needed.
Not modified to use with longer output.

1Dplot_longer
Same as 1Dplot, but modified for longer output.

1Dplot_temp_DO
Contour plots of DO and temperature inputs for June 1 - October 15.
Must compile 'colorbar.pro' before this runs.
